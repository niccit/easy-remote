# Easy Remote with LED Display

## The Need
As my mom gets older, she is having trouble working the remote for her Roku devices. I'm often called to her house to fix the TV along with other things.

I searched for a senior-friendly remote that worked with Roku but was unable to find one that didn't have way too many tiny buttons on it.

## The Solution
Build a 4-button remote with a large display.

Color code the buttons, LED lights on the keyboard, and text on the display.

This project is tailored to her watching habits, however, it can be easily modified.

In addition to the keypad this implementation will:
- Interact with the TV streaming Netflix every hour to avoid the "Are you still watching message"
- Turn on the bedroom TV automatically
- Turn both televisions off automatically

## The hardware
All the hardware is from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com).

- [NeoKey 1x4 QT I2C - Four Mechanical Key Switches with NeoPixels - STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4980)
- [Kailh Mechanical Key Switches - Clicky White - 10 pack - Cherry MX White Compatible](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4955)

The keycaps are 3D printed and I will attach a link to the files at project completion

The case (yet to be designed and printed) will house all the hardware and will be coded in OpenSCAD. That file will be included along with the STL as part of this project
